# Trailers
Sick and tired of changing vehicles.meta files to make your beautiful addon trailer work? Look no further! As long as your towing vehicle has the `attach_female` bone and the trailer has the `attach_male` bone setup properly, you should see a notification that you can attach the trailer as you get close to the hitch. By default, the key to attach the vehicle is `G` or whatever your detonate keybind is.
